abstract: |
  On June 2023 Annette has asked for the analysis of RNA-Seq samples. The project goal is the differential expression analysis of comntrol samples against WDR26 or WDR26-mutant overexpressed samples. Additional request was to run a gage analysis on the resulted DE genes.
  The ultimate goal is the comparison of the transcriptomics results against the protoemics data set extracted from the same conditions.

## Preparation

The raw data is saved on the pool folder `pool-bcfngs` and was linked to my working folder.

```{bash}
mkdir -p /fs/pool/pool-cox-projects-bioinformatics/AG_Murray/Annette/P683/rawData
cd rawData/
ln -s /home/yeroslaviz/poolFolders/pool-bcfngs/fastq_files/P683/P683_2023_05_16_PM_AG_HEK_transient_transfection/conc.fastq/*.gz .
```

# QC

Quality control was done using the `fastqc` tool [@fastqc, v. 0.11.7] within the automated sequencing pipeline. QC looks good for all samples.

generating a report using `multiQC` [@multiqc, v. 1.14]  summarizing the QC Results. 


```{bash}
conda activate Mapping
multiqc -o QC /home/yeroslaviz/poolFolders/pool-bcfngs/fastq_files/P683/P683_2023_05_16_PM_AG_HEK_transient_transfection/fastqcResults/
```











Based on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every `r round(avg_years_between_eruptions, 1)` years on average.

Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).

Eight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).

Data and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.

Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution

$$
p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
$$ {#eq-poisson}

where $\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.
